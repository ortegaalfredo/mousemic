# mousemic
Simple tool to visualize and amplify mouse movements.

This utility uses a high-level X11 Api so is not really more sensitive than your screen.

It requires the package libsdl-dev to build on Debian/Ubuntu. 

"Make" should produce an executable. Adjust "ZOOM" variable in source code to increase/decrease amplification.
